    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> (<i>folding up brief</i>) Ah, the old story! I need read no more. (<i>lays down the brief and rises</i>) What’s this? (<i>picks up a letter lying on the edge of the desk</i>) Oh—ah!—the letter that came by this morning’s post for Philip. A woman’s writing. How alike they write! The very double of my niece’s hand!

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Yes, I have done work for to-night. Come in. I am afraid I have neglected you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Not in the least. I stayed upstairs on purpose, knowing you were busy. I have been unpacking.</p>

    <p class="direction">(<i><span class="name">Sir George</span> draws forward chair, <span class="stage">C.</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Sit down. You must be tired after your journey.</p>

    <p class="direction">(<i>sits on the end of the lounge, facing audience</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> (<i>sits, <span class="stage">C.</span></i>) I <i>was</i> tired and hungry, but your cook has kindly seen to that.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Lady Carlyon had quite given you up, or she would have stayed in to welcome you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> My train was very late.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Oh, by-the-bye (<i>rises</i>) there is a letter waiting for you. (<i>gives it him</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Thanks. (<i><span class="name">Sir George</span> resumes his seat—aside</i>) Rose’s hand. (<i>pockets it</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> My wife is at the theatre.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Oh!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> We have had another visitor to-day—a niece of mine, who has come from abroad. I promised I would take her to the play, but just as I was leaving chambers some<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-4">[Pg 4]</a></span> briefs tumbled in, and I thought it might be as well to glance them over; so my wife has taken her.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Lady Carlyon is quite well, I hope.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Perfectly, thank you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> It is two years since I saw her.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> So it is. We have seen nothing of you lately—you, whom we used to see so much of. Where have you been?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Well, all over the world. The day I met you, when you were so kind as to invite me here, was the day of my arrival home.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> So kind as to invite you! My dear boy, you raised objections enough to my invitation.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> I was afraid of trespassing on your hospitality.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> And so you have been round the world?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> From Dan to Beersheba.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> And you found all barren?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> On the contrary, I’ve had a very jolly time—especially upon the voyage home.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> You look the better for it.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> I am a new man.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> You weren’t well when you went away.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> I was depressed and out of sorts.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> So I observed.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> You noticed it?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> And I remember thinking at the time there was a woman in the case.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> That is all over now. I am as happy as the sandboy in the saying.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Then, there’s another woman in the case.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> My dear Sir George, according to your views, there is a woman in every case.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> (<i>pointing to table</i>) There are some twenty briefs. Open which one of them you please, and somewhere in the folds you’ll find a petticoat.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> What, twenty women hidden in these briefs?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> At least. There never was a case without a woman in it, and I never leave one till I’ve found her; for I know well enough until I do I have not mastered it. There is a woman in your case, my friend.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> To tell the truth, there is. A charming girl I met upon the voyage home.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> The jolly voyage home!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> I am in love this time, Sir George.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Oh, yes! we always are in love this time.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> I thought I was before, but I was wrong.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Of course! we never were before!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> And, better still, I am engaged.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> What, to the charming girl?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> The only girl in the wide world for me.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Well, you’ve been round it, so you ought to know. I hope you will be happy. It’s a toss-up, Philip.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> I’m afraid your profession makes you cynical.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Gad, it would make an angel cynical.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> No doubt, you meet with some extraordinary cases.</p>

    <p class="direction">(<i>turning over briefs</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Never. All ordinary. To a man who has had twenty years’ experience, no possible case can appear extraordinary. There aren’t three there of which I didn’t know the end before I turned a page. No wonder we don’t always read our briefs, for we know most of them by heart.</p>

    <p class="direction">(<i>lies back</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Hallo! (<i>smiling</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> What have you found?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> A breach of promise case. This looks amusing.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Very amusing for the judge and jury. Very amusing for the public too. Very amusing for the new-made wife to read in all the newspapers her husband’s past.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Is the defendant married, then?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Of course he is. They always are. And of course he was on with the new love before he was off with the old. They always will be. The old love was no better than she need be, and no more was he. Very amusing for the new love, isn’t it?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Of course the letters will be read in court?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> And published in the papers. “November, 1877—your own loving and devoted Harry. (laughter) November, 1878—Yours most affectionately, Henry. (loud laughter) November, 1879—Yours truly, Henry Horrocks. (roars of laughter).” Oh, it’s a most amusing case—for Mrs. Henry Horrocks.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Why don’t you settle it? You are for the defendant.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> We’ve tried, but it’s too late. Take warning by my client.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> I?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> You be in time, if you are not too late already.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Excuse me, mine was quite a different case. Thank heaven, I have no reason to reproach myself. There was no love, at any rate on my side, in the matter you allude to.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> And yet you fled the country to avoid the lady. (<i>sitting up</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> I never said so.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> No, my boy; you never said that two and two makes four, but it does, doesn’t it? (<i>looking at <span class="name">Philip</span> through his glasses</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> No doubt. I felt that my position was——(<i>hesitates</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Equivocal.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> That is the word I wanted.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Useful word.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> And feeling that, I thought the best course was to——</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Run away.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> But as for promises of marriage, there was nothing of that sort. In fact, there couldn’t be.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Because the lady was already——</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Hang it, Sir George, <i>you’re</i> telling <i>me</i> my case!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> (<i>drops glasses</i>) You’ll find it in the third brief on your right.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> (<i>looking at brief</i>) “Winter <i>v.</i> Winter and Hockheimer”?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> That’s your case, as far as it has gone.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> (<i>takes up brief and reads endorsement</i>) “In the High Court of Justice—Probate and”—— But this is a divorce case!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Just so.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Oh, that’s not my case. (<i>puts brief back in its place</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> I said as far as it had gone. Hockheimer ran away. You ran away. But Hockheimer came back again. And I observe that <i>you’ve</i> come back again.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> But I’m not Hockheimer!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> As far as you have gone. Hockheimer was a friend of Winter’s——</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> But I’m <i>not!</i> I never saw the man in my life!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> No, but the other man?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> What other man?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> The husband.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> I didn’t say he was my friend!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Oh, yes, you did.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> When did I say so?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> When you ran away. (<i>puts glasses up</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Spare me, Sir George. You make me feel like a witness under cross-examination. I didn’t mean to breathe a word of this, and somehow I have told you everything.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Well, you have told me a good deal. (<i>drops glasses</i>) Now, will you let me give you my advice?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> By all means.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Those glasses worry me.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> (<i>dropping the eye-glasses</i>) I beg your pardon; it’s the force of habit. Off with the old love—friend—or what you will—and never let the new one see her. Off with her entirely! That’s my advice; and many a hundred guineas have been paid for worse.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Oh, they will never meet. I mean to live abroad. The girl I am engaged to is a South Australian. (<i><span class="name">Sir George</span> lifts his head quickly</i>) And she has only come to England on a visit.

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Well, you have done so most effectually. Tell me, does Lady Carlyon know of our engagement?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Well, how did you enjoy the play?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Rose.</span> Oh, so much, Uncle George! Although it was in French, I followed every word.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> It is the French plays you have been to?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> What was the piece?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> “Une Chaine,” by Eugène Scribe.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> I don’t remember it.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Rose.</span> And it is so exciting. There is a young man in it—such a nice young man, with a moustache—oh, such a sweet moustache!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Well?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Rose.</span> He’s in love.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Of course.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Rose.</span> With a young girl—oh, such a stupid girl! I can’t think what he could have seen in her—and <i>she’s</i> in love with <i>him</i>.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> And they get married, I suppose.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Rose.</span> In the last act; but in the meantime there is such a to-do.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Why?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Rose.</span> It appears, before the play began, the hero—the young man——</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> With the moustache——</p>

    <p><span class="name">Rose.</span> Had been in love with someone else.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Ah!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Rose.</span> But now he doesn’t care for her a bit.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> What is the difficulty, then?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Rose.</span> <i>She</i> cares for <i>him</i>; and though he’s trying through the whole four acts, do what he will, he can’t get rid of her.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> I see. That is the chain.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Rose.</span> He nearly breaks it half a dozen times, but something always happens to prevent him. You’ve no idea how interesting it is—although, of course, it’s very, very wrong.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Why wrong?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Rose.</span> Well, you see, someone else is married; and of course she oughtn’t to care anything about the nice young man.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Although he has so lovely a moustache.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Rose.</span> But she does—which is wicked—but it’s very interesting.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> (<i>to <span class="name">Lady Carlyon</span></i>) What did <i>you</i> think of it, my dear?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> It is a painful subject.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Rose.</span> Aunt Bell didn’t like it; but she took it all so seriously. If it were real, it would be very sad; but after all what is it but a play? Besides, it all takes place in Paris: nobody pretends that such things happen here.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> Of course. (<i>quickly</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Of course. (<i>quickly</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> (<i>ironically</i>) Of course. (<i>takes up the third brief on his right—and plays with it</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Rose.</span> I read a notice of the piece this morning, and I quite agreed with it.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> What did the notice say?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Rose.</span> It said it was “an admirable play, but that an English version of it was impossible.”</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Why so?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Rose.</span> “Because”—how did it put it?—oh, “because these vivid but unwholesome pictures of French life have happily no”—something—I forget exactly what—“to the chaste beauty of our English homes.” I can’t remember the precise words, but I know the criticism made me long to see the play.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> (<i>putting the brief back in its place, after he sees it has caught <span class="name">Philip’s</span> eyes</i>) Of course it filled the theatre?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> The house was crowded, and the atmosphere was insupportable. (<i>smells bouquet</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> No doubt; if you were bending all night long over those sickly flowers. (<i>crosses to her—she rises</i>) Give them to me. (<i>takes bouquet</i>) Why, they are almost withered.</p>

    <p class="direction">(<i>comes, <span class="stage">C.</span>, with bouquet</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> They were fresh yesterday.</p>

    <p class="direction">(<i>holds the bouquet, head downwards</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Rose.</span> It wasn’t the flowers, though. Aunt Bell didn’t like the play</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> It isn’t everybody who admires French plays.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> (<i>to <span class="name">Lady Carlyon</span></i>) What, were you scandalised? You must know, Philip—you do know, of course—Lady Carlyon is a dragon in her way—the very pink and pattern of propriety. Now, I’ll be bound, she didn’t like the moral of that comedy.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> Had it a moral?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Certainly! and one men would do well to lay to heart. If that young man——</p>

    <p><span class="name">Rose.</span> The one with the moustache?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Had buried his first love when it was dead, he wouldn’t have been haunted by its ghost. When passion is burnt out, sweep the hearth clean, and clear away the ash, before you set alight another fire. It is a law of life. Old things give place to new. The loves of yesterday are like these faded flowers, fit only to be cast into the flames. (<i>flings bouquet into fire</i>) That is the moral: and I call it excellent. (<i>sits, <span class="stage">C.,</span> and looks at <span class="name">Philip</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> (<i>aside</i>) He doesn’t speak to me. Am <i>I</i> a faded flower? (<i>sits, <span class="stage">L.</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Rose.</span> Very good, Uncle George. That ought to get the verdict. (<i>leaning upon his shoulder</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Let us hope it will. (<i>looking at <span class="name">Philip</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> I never knew him to have any, since I was his wife. It’s not his fault. A man in his position has so much to do. When he is not in court, he is in Parliament.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Rose.</span> Why was it cruel?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> What did it make you think of Madame de Saint Géran?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Rose.</span> Well—I thought she was a very wicked woman. Wasn’t she?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> Perhaps. But if we had been told her history—if we had ever been in her position—we might have sympathised with her. Were you ever in love?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Rose.</span> Yes! I mean no! I can’t exactly say.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> If you had been, you wouldn’t hesitate. There is no doubt about it. It is a weird thing. Sometimes it leads to heights, sometimes to depths. I do not say it is an excuse. All I say is, those who have never loved are not entitled to judge those who have. Wait till you are in love yourself, before you judge poor Madame de Saint Géran.

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Never.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Nor she with you? (<i>pause</i>) Eh?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Once.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Ah! Now I understand the case. May I inquire what you propose to do?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> To see her and to tell her I am going to be married.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> What does that put an end to?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Everything.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> What, friendship?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Well——</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> You said friendship.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Yes.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Does marriage put an end to friendship? I hope not.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Of course it doesn’t, but——</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> That friendship must be put an end to. Philip, you are the son of an old comrade, and I believe that, if you start fair, you will make an admirable husband. But you <i>must</i> start fair, or you won’t. I don’t ask you to bring to me a spotless character—a history without a speck or flaw; all I ask—and on that I insist—is that you shall begin your future life unhampered by the past.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> What would you have me do?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Make your fair friend distinctly understand that all—however little that all may have been—is over.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Will that satisfy you?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Yes; but I must have proof she understands it.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> What sort of proof?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> We lawyers have great faith in black and white. You laymen think it a cumbrous form; but I have seen too many fortunes turn on a forgotten sheet of notepaper, not to appreciate its value.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> What do you mean?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> That you must bring to me a letter from your friend——</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> A letter from her!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> A mere acknowledgment that all is over.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> A letter!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Signed, mind you, signed.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Signed! (<i>his cry wakes <span class="name">Lady Carlyon</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Nothing like a signature.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> (<i>rising</i>) Wouldn’t you like it stamped as well, Sir George? (<i><span class="name">Lady Carlyon</span> moves slightly</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> A penny postage stamp will be enough.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> That is impossible.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> It must be got.

I claim to be no better than my kind. When I was married, I too was entangled. I was a rising man—and it was necessary that I should obtain a seat in Parliament. Lady Carlyon’s father had much influence in the county which I represent. My marriage was political. I had a charming wife, who did her best to love me, heaven knows; and <i>I</i> might have loved <i>her</i>, if this entanglement from which I could not extricate myself had not been there. But there it was, and with a woman’s quickness she discovered it. I know she did, although she never spoke; and with a generosity which I can never repay, she did not add to my embarrassment. What was the sequel? Death cut the knot which I could not unravel. I am free. Now, many a time amongst these dead dry bones (<i>pointing to briefs</i>) I hunger for the love it is too late to win. Still that accursed past stands like a wall betwixt my wife and me. (<i>returns, <span class="stage">C.</span></i>) Profit by my experience. (<i>sits, <span class="stage">C.</span></i> )</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> No doubt, the course you recommend would be the proper course to take, if it were possible; but in the circumstances it is quite impossible.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Difficult, perhaps, but not impossible. Have no<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-15">[Pg 15]</a></span> false delicacy in a case like this. This lady—I presume, whoever she may be, she <i>is</i> a lady—who is fond of <i>you</i>, for that is evident, but of whose friendship you are weary, must be sacrificed. I pity her, but there is no help for it.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> None! but a letter is out of the question.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Why?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> How could I ask her—oh, it is impossible!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Then, you do feel for her?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> I can’t help pitying her.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Sir George (<i>rises</i>), I give you my assurance as a gentleman, nothing has passed between us but kind words. I never loved her; and when I think of all the trouble she has brought on me—how she has banished me for months abroad—how nearly she has made me a false friend—I hate the very mention of her name!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Nay, how you startled us!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> How so?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> By calling out.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> Forgive me for disturbing you, but I was dreaming.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> And not a pleasant dream, apparently. Why, you are trembling all over.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> (<i>smiling</i>) So I am.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> And you cried out as though you were in pain.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> It was in terror. I dreamt that I was walking on the edge of a high cliff.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> Pshaw!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> Philip was with me.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> You had a safe escort.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> But the path grew so difficult, we had to separate. I followed him; when suddenly he turned and——</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> And what?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> Flung me over! I shrieked out, “Philip!”—and awoke.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> That was what startled us.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> Forgive me. Mr. Graham, for having even dreamt that you could be so little chivalrous.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> No.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> You have overheard my conversation with Sir George?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> The end of it.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> And you cried out because——</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> I realised the truth.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> I didn’t weigh my words. Perhaps I over-stated——</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> That will do. (<i>pause</i>) You chose a curious confidant!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> I had no choice. Sir George is so acute; he guessed so much, I had to pass it off by asking him to give me his advice.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> It was a dangerous expedient. Does he suspect—who——</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> No.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> Though he is so acute?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Those who are gifted with long sight are often blind to what is at their feet.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> How did you come to talk on such a subject?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> I had been telling him——</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> Go on.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> Oh. (<i>quite calmly</i>) That was your secret? (<i>sits</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Yes. He guessed the reason why I went abroad, and putting this and that together, he divined there was a difficulty.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> What is the difficulty?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> The lady to whom I am engaged is not yet of age, and those who have the care of her insist upon some proof that our acquaintanceship is at an end.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> They also know——</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Not who you are!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> What?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> Why, a letter with your signature! It is outrageous!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady C.</span> Does Sir George think so?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Philip.</span> He agrees with them.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> How was I generous?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> I was not generous. (<i>each looking in the other’s eyes with meaning</i>) I simply paid a debt of honour I have owed too long. If I <i>was</i> generous, was it not you who taught me generosity?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir G.</span> But I shall never mention it. (<i>embrace</i>)</p>

    <p class="noindent">These images, which were scanned from a copy made available by the University of Toronto Libraries, are of an undated edition printed in London by Samuel French. The estimated date of publication is 1885. A secondary source, also posted by the Internet Archive, was consulted:</p>

    <p class="noindent">These images, which were made available by the University of California, are of an edition printed in Philadelphia by the Penn Publishing Company in 1912.</p>

    <p>French’s Acting Editions from the nineteenth century tend to have minor editorial inconsistencies and errors as well as errors introduced in the printing process, depending on the condition and inking of the plates. Thus, for example, it is at times difficult to determine whether a certain letter is an “c,” “e,” or “o” or whether a certain punctuation mark is a period or a comma. Where context made the choice obvious, the obvious reading was given the benefit of the doubt without comment.</p>

    <p>The following changes were noted:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>Throughout the text, the use of dashes has been made consistent.</li>

      <li>p. 3: Based on the Penn edition and editorial practice in other contemporaneous French’s Acting Editions, three colons in the opening scene description were changed to semicolons.</li>

      <li>p. 4: The only girl in the wide world for me—Added a period at the end of the sentence.</li>

      <li>p. 8: <span class="name">Sir George</span> (<i>putting chair…</i>—Changed “<span class="name">Sir George</span>” to “<span class="name">Sir G.</span>” for consistency.</li>

      <li>p. 9: Of course. (<i>quickl&nbsp;y</i>)—Deleted space in “<i>quickl&nbsp;y</i>” in two consecutive lines.</li>

      <li>p. 10: <span class="name">Sir. G.</span> Why so?—Deleted period after “<span class="name">Sir</span>”.</li>

      <li>p. 10: <span class="name">Sib G.</span> (<i>putting the brief…</i>—Changed “<span class="name">Sib G.</span>” to “<span class="name">Sir G.</span>”.</li>

     <li>p. 10: <span class="name">Sir. G.</span>  Let us hope it will.—Deleted period after “<span class="name">Sir</span>”.</li>

      <li>p. 10: …and hear you plead,—Changed comma to period.</li>

      <li>p. 11: What can they have to talk about—those two? (<i>reflectiv&nbsp;ly</i>)—Inserted “e” in <i>reflectiv&nbsp;ly</i>.</li>

      <li>p. 12: It is a weird thing Sometimes—Inserted period after “thing”.</li>

      <li>p. 14: I know she did, although she never spoke: and…—Changed colon to semicolon, as in Penn edition.</li>

      <li>p. 17: Are youno better?—Inserted space after “you”.</li>

      <li>p. 18: <span class="name">Sir G.</span> What—Added a question mark after “What”.</li>

      <li>p. 19: (<i>reads nervously, the l&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trembling in his hands</i>)—Changed “<i>l</i>” to “<i>letter</i>”.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>The html version of this etext attempts to reproduce the layout of the printed text. However, some concessions have been made. For example, in the printed text stage directions following a line of dialogue were placed a couple spaces after the dialogue, flush right on the same printed line, or flush right on the next line. In the etext, all stage directions printed on the same line were placed right after the dialogue. Stage directions printed on the next line were indented from the left margin, and coded as hanging paragraphs.</p>
